This happens when the size of the training data set is too small, or when the complexity of our chosen model exceeds the complexity of the true distribution. Moreover, when classical NNs are applied to supervised learning tasks, they're overconfident in their predictions, particularly in regions of unknown phase space (e.g. when asked to classify an image belonging to a class the network wasn't traind on). \n",

        "Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) introduce uncertainy in the weights of the network. According to standard Bayesian methods, the weights are treated as stochastic variables described by probability distributions. A BNN is trained to learn a distribution over the weights, rather than a single point estimate as in a classical NN. The Bayesian treatment of the weights acts as a regularizer preventing overfitting. It also results in reacher learnt representations and predictions, since the final prediction is given as the averaging of an ensemble of networks, each defined by a set of weights drawn from the learnt probability distribution. Network ensembling gives also a better way to evaluate the uncertainty, taking into account the epistemic uncertainty due to the uncertainty in the weights. "

        "### Implementation of variational layer\n",
        "\n",
        "In order to train a Bayesian neural network with variational inference we'll need a variational layer. We will define a *DenseVariational* layer by hand, so that we can put into practice what we learned in class. To create a new layer we'll use Keras Layer class. \n",
        "\n",
        "The layer is initialized with the number of hidden units we want in the layer, the weight $\\frac{1}{m}$ of the *kl_loss* in case we use mini-batches, and the hyperparameters of our model. Note that among the hyperparameters there are the parameters of the Gaussian mixture prior, which we said we would fix before training.\n",
        "\n",
        "In Keras API the `build(self, inputs_shape)` method allows us to create the layer weights, and in particular it  allows us to instantiate the layer without knowing the size of the input. The `call()` method will automatically run build the first time it is called. In our layer we will have 3 types of weights that are named *kernel_mu*, *kernel_rho* and *bias_mu*. \n",
        "\n",
        "Recall that the output of a NN layer is given by $h(\\mathbf{x}) =s( W^T \\mathbf{x} + \\mathbf{b})$. In the code the weights $W$ are referred to as *kernel* and $\\mathbf{b}$ is the *bias*. We will obtain a posterior distribution over the weights $W$, while we will treat the bias as a deterministic parameter (we don't define an uncertainty for it). Note that the bias has the dimension of the number of hidden units, since we have one bias term per node, while the kernel ($W$) has dimension `(input_shape, units)`. Each weight $w \\in W$ will be parametrized by $w = \\mu + \\epsilon * \\sigma$, where $\\sigma$ is defined in terms of $\\rho$ as explaind above. Thus our trainable parameters will be the bias vector *bias_mu* and the matrices *kernel_mu* and *kernel_rho*.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "The method `add_loss()` can be used to create loss tensors and is called within the `call()` method. These losses work seamlessly with fit(): they get automatically summed and added to the main loss. We use the  `add_loss()` method to define our *kl_loss*, the term in the cost functin that does not depend on the data and that can be computed layer-wise. Note that to compute the *kl_loss* we need to evaluate the variational distribution with the current state of the variational parameters and the prior probability for the given weight."

These predictions will vary because each time we call `model_predict` we are sampling a different weight configuration. As we mentioned before, we can make predictions by taking the average of the ensemble. The standard deviation of the predictions will give us the uncertainty.

        "Note how the epistemic uncertainty reported in the region where we have training data is larger. This is because now we are including also the uncertainty on the bias paramater. When the bias was treated deterministically the model was overfitting the bias parameters to the training data. This resulted at the testing stage in better performance in the region where it was trained on, but it produced a larger uncertainty in unseen regions. On the other hand, now that the model doesn't have the possibility to overtrain, the uncertainty is slghtly greater in the training region, but we have a smaller ucertainty in out-of-training-data regions. Note also how now the predicted average is just at 0 in these regions, while before it was drifting upward: the bias was biased!"

        "In this notebook we have followed the approach described in the paper *Weight Uncertainty in Neural Networks* to building a neural network with variational layers. We saw how by using a variational layer we can train also on the uncertainty of the model parameters. This allows us to take into account the epistemic uncertainty in our predictions, as each prediction is obtained by drawing a random weight configuration from the postrior distribution. The result is an ensemble of neural networks which we can describe with standard MC sampling statistics. Note however that the model does not address the aleatoric in the data. We will cover this in the next notebook. "
